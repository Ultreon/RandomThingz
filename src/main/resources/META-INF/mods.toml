§l§nBugs / Feature requests§r
  §cIn Alpha / Beta releases stuff might change or break, it's recommended to use them for testing purposes only.§r
  If there's a problem with the mod: don't post the crash report in the comments, but post it on the issue tracker here.
  If there's no crash report but it still crashes, post the debug.log file in your .minecraft/logs folder to the issue tracker.
  If there's no crash report and there's no crash in the debug.log, then there's probably a problem with your Java / Computer.

This Mod is partially forked from: https://github.com/PianoManu/QTextureModels
The mod was merged after the base essentials of QForgeMod were created.

Original description:
Fork Mod of Carpenter's Blocks Mod created by Mineshopper (owner of the idea) for older versions of Minecraft.
I created this fork because friends of mine would like to play this mod on 1.15 (and me too).

Right now there is no guide for this mod, so here is one in small form:
- Right-Click on a frame block to give it the texture of the block you clicked it with
- Right-Click with the hammer to get the block back out of the frame (you can change this feature in the config file, so that you only need an empty hand and Sneak-Rightclick)
- For blocks with different textures on each side, you can select the texture you want using the texture wrench
- Let the blocks glow by right-clicking them with glowstone dust or coal/charcoal
- You can also change the appearance of a block by right-clicking it with the chisel and the paintbrush

Have fun!
