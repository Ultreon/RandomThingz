Place a bucket of milk into a furnace (no smoker or blast furnace) to make cheese 
take two wheat to make a hamburger bun
take two hamburger buns (1 top-mid 1 bottom-mid), 1 piece of cooked meat of any kind except fish, jerky and tomahawk, 1 piece of sliced cheese and 1 red or brown mushroom in any order in the middle row 
you get 3 cheese slices in the crafting table from 1 cheese
you cant eat the bigass block of cheese in your hand but you can place it on the ground like a cake
3 bites and its gone
slightly smaller than an actual cake
if you break it, it gives you cheese slices
